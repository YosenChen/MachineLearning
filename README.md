My machine learning projects

1. Stanford CME323 course project: Parallel Reinforcement Learning on Spark using MapReduce Framework
2. Stanford CS229 course project: Machine Learning for Different Calligraphy Style Recognition
    2.1. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), SVM, Random Forests, Softmax methods were implemented
    2.2. HOG features and some image preprocessing techniques were applied
    2.3. Course website archive (http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2016.html): Machine Learning for Different Calligraphers Style Recognition, Yu-Sheng Chen, Haihong Li, Guangjun Su
3. Stanford CS221 course project: Collaborative Multiagent Map Exploration using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
    3.1. Oracle, baseline, and proposed RL methods were implemented and investigated
4. Stanford EE367 course project: Machine Learning Methods for Image Demosaicing and Denoising
    4.1. kNN and linear regression methods were implemented to predict image details for demosaicing
    4.2. ADMM image optimization method were implemented for demosaicing with TV prior assumption
    4.3. Course website archive: http://stanford.edu/class/ee367/Winter2017/Chen_Sanchez_ee367_win17_report.pdf

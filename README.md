My machine learning projects

1. Stanford CME323 course project: Parallel Reinforcement Learning on Spark using MapReduce Framework

2. Stanford CS229 course project: Machine Learning for Different Calligraphy Style Recognition

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), SVM, Random Forests, Softmax methods were implemented
- HOG features and some image preprocessing techniques were applied
- Course website archive (http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2016.html): Machine Learning for Different Calligraphers Style Recognition, Yu-Sheng Chen, Haihong Li, Guangjun Su

3. Stanford CS221 course project: Collaborative Multiagent Map Exploration using Reinforcement Learning (RL)

- Oracle, baseline, and proposed RL methods were implemented and investigated

4. Stanford EE367 course project: Machine Learning Methods for Image Demosaicing and Denoising

- kNN and linear regression methods were implemented to predict image details for demosaicing
- ADMM image optimization method were implemented for demosaicing with TV prior assumption
